# Lesson 01 - Neurons

[![Earnest says "Yeah, my Neural Network uses a 3 dimensional input neuron vector, so what-". There is a list on a screen showing numbers 1,2, and 3. Ann asks Earnest "You mean that?"][comic0]][comic0]

## Neural networks don't have neurons

People in the machine learning industry love to throw around the word neuron.

And why shouldn't they? It's a great word. It brings to mind discoveries in neuroscience and _futuristic AI_ that can think and feel. _However,_ the use of it in machine learning is redundant. Neural network documentation makes more sense if you remove the word neuron entirely.

- For example:
	- "I'm feeding in two 3-dimensional input neurons"
- Can easily become:
	- "I'm feeding in two 3-dimensional inputs"

(This applies to general purpose machine learning - not for models of neurons)

[![Line says "Hi- I'm a line, i.e. a 1-dimensional vector-space!" The line goes from Ok at 0 to Spooky at 4. Line asks self "..but which memes are the freshest?" after seeing Salt Bae and Badger are both Ok at 0 and Skeleton is Spooky at 4. The line becomes a square, and line says "I'm now a square, i.e. a 2-dimensional vector-space". Salt Bae is Ok and Fresh at 0,17. Badger is Ok and Stale at 0,3. Skeleton is Spooky and somewhat fresh as 4,12.][comic1]][comic1]

$$
\textrm{A line can measure spookiness,} \\
\textrm{ but one must master the square} \\
\textrm{ to list spookiness and freshness.}
$$

Now let's look at the _dimensions_ of the inputs.

In many entry-level machine learning tutorials, they usually don't explain what they mean by a  `N-dimensional vector space` (Looking at you, [tensorflow "beginner" tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners)). It's simple. 

As in the spooky-fresh comic above, think of a `vector space` as a shape. An `N-dimensional` vector space is just a __line__ for `N=1`, a __square__ for `N=2`, a _cube_ for `N=3`, or a _hypercube_ for `N>3`. It's best never to speak of _hypercubes_. Let's focus on __lines__ and __squares__.

[1.0]: #vectors-explained-with-memes
### Vectors explained with memes

A _vector_ is a _list of directions in a space_.
- In the case of a __line__ _(1-dimensional space)_
	- A `vector` like `[4]` is offset from `[0]` by:
		- four steps along the line from zero.
- For a __square__ _(2-dimensional space)_
	- A `vector` like `[4,12]` is offset from `[0,0]` by
		- four steps along the first edge.
		- twelve steps along the second edge.


But really, A _vector_ is a just a __list of numbers__.

Each _input vector_ should just be called an _input list of numbers_, an _input list_, or simply a _list_. Each number in the _input list_ just describes an input. You add a _dimension_ just by adding one number to the _input list_. An _N-dimensional input vector_ is just __a list of N numbers__. 

For the 1-dimensional __line__, the _input list_ has one number like `[0]`. For the 2-dimensional __square__, the _input list_ has two numbers like `[0,0]`. 

 Here's a table of both _numbers_ and both _lists_ for each input in [the comic][1].

| Icon | spooky | fresh | `[spooky]` | `[spooky, fresh]` |
| ---- | ---------- | --------- | -------- | --------------- |
| ![spooky][spooky] | 4 | 12 | `[4]` | `[4,12]` |
| ![cute][cute] | 0 | 3 | `[0]` | `[0,3]` |
| ![salt][salt] | 0 | 17 | `[0]` | `[0,17]` |


The lists giving `[spooky]` will not answer questions about freshness. You need an _input list_ giving `[spooky,fresh]` to teach a network to find the _freshest_. To know anything about _freshness_, each _input list_ must have _a number for freshness_.

- If each _input list_ has two numbers like this: `[spooky, fresh] = [0,0]`, 
- And two of the _input lists_ are `[0,3]` for ![cute][cute] and `[0,17]` for ![salt][salt],
	- Then a network can learn that ![salt][salt] is _much fresher_ than ![cute][cute].

__In general__, you need to list one number in the _input list_ __for each thing you know__ about your data like _spookiness_, _freshness_, or even _spiciness_.

[1.1]: #lets-just-call-vectors-lists
### Let's just call vectors lists

In the [first panel][0], L'earnest describes his `3 dimensional input neuron vector`.

From what we learned about vectors, the inputs are lists of 3 numbers that give all we know about each input. When running a network, a `3 dimensional vector` would just be a __list with three numbers__ like this:
```
input = [1,2,3]
```
If these are `spooky-fresh-spicy` inputs, the above input list could mean `spookiness=1`, `freshness=2`, and `spiciness=3`. 

Or, since the ![spooky][spooky] meme has `spookiness=4`, `freshness=12`, and `spiciness=0`,

```
input = [4,12,0]
```

There is no need to use a word like `dimensional` to talk about the inputs you feed into your neural network. 

__Helpful Translations:__

- L'earnest would say:
	- "I'm feeding in two 3-dimensional input neurons."
- He should have said:
	- "I'm feeding in two inputs of 3-number lists."

- L'earnest would say:
	- "I need another dimension to represent my input vector."
- He should have said:
	- "I need to list another number for each input."
